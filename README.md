# Elevate_Labs_Task8 
This repo is focusing on VPN setup and configuration analysis.

## Task Objectives
- Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication
- Gain hands-on experience with VPN client setup and configuration
- Analyze VPN security features, benefits, and limitations
- Document the complete process with evidence and screenshots

## Tools Used
- **VPN Service**: ProtonVPN (Free Tier)
- **IP Verification**: whatismyipaddress.com
- **Speed Testing**: speedtest.net or similar
- **Documentation**: Markdown format

## Methodology
1. **Account Setup**: Created free ProtonVPN account
2. **Client Installation**: Downloaded and installed VPN client
3. **Connection Testing**: Established VPN connection and verified functionality
